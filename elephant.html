        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Elephants are the largest existing land animals. Three living
            species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the
            African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are an
            informal grouping within the proboscidean family Elephantidae.
            Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct
            members include the mastodons. Elephantidae also contains several
            extinct groups, including the mammoths and straight-tusked
            elephants. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs,
            whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level
            backs. The distinctive features of all elephants include a long
            proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and
            tough but sensitive skin. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing
            food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are
            derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools
            for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in
            maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication.
            The pillar-like legs carry their great weight. "
